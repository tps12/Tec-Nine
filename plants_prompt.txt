Please give me a JSON object with information about a list of plants that I will provide below.

I want to know what kind of enviroment each plant can live in, and what it needs to survive.

The object should have a key for each plant, and a value object with its information.

Fields to provide in the JSON value object are:

  - temperatureRange: a string like "$LOW-$HIGH" that represents the temperature range where the plant could live, in Celsius.
  - precipitationRange: a string like "$LOW-$HIGH" that represents the range of annual precipitation where the plant could live, in centimeters.
  - sunlightRange: a string like "$LOW-$HIGH" that represents the amount of annual sunlight the plant needs to survive, in hours.
  - kind: what kind of plant the plant is; one of {quoted_plant_kinds}.
  - maximumHeight: how tall the plant can grow, in meters.
  - evergreen: true if the plant is green all year.
  - sealife: true if the plant grows underwater.

  - fruits: true if the plant grows fruit.
  - nuts: true if the plant produces nuts.
  - seeds: true if the plant produces seeds.
